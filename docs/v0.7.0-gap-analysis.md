# v0.7.0 Gap Analysis - Filesystem Testing Parity with rdf-bench

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Version:** v0.7.0 (Directory Tree Support)  
**Status:** Design Complete, Implementation In Progress

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** sai3-bench has 65% feature parity with rdf-bench for filesystem testing, with a clear path to 85% after implementing the tree creation logic. The remaining 15% (I/O rate control + journaling) would require substantial additional engineering effort.

**Strategic Position:** Our 85% includes unique cloud storage capabilities (S3/Azure/GCS) that rdf-bench cannot match, making sai3-bench a complementary tool rather than a pure replacement.

---

## Question 1: Can we comprehensively test shared filesystems with metadata operations and controllable contention?

### Short Answer: NOT YET - we have 80% of the infrastructure, but NOT the implementation.

### What We HAVE ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ `DirectoryTree` module with width/depth hierarchical structure generation
- ‚úÖ Metadata operations (`mkdir`, `rmdir`) implemented in workload.rs
- ‚úÖ Config structs for all coordination modes (isolated/coordinator/concurrent)
- ‚úÖ Config structs for all path selection strategies (random/partitioned/exclusive/weighted)
- ‚úÖ 30 comprehensive tests proving config parsing works
- ‚úÖ Design document with 6 example scenarios (`DIRECTORY_TREE_SHARED_FILESYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)

### What We DON'T HAVE ‚ùå (Implementation Gaps)

- ‚ùå **No integration between PrepareConfig and DirectoryTree** - the `directory_structure` field exists but isn't used
- ‚ùå **No tree creation logic in prepare phase** - DirectoryTree.new() is never called outside tests
- ‚ùå **No path selection logic in workload** - agents don't use tree_creation_mode or path_selection
- ‚ùå **No coordination between agents** - concurrent mode has no actual concurrency handling
- ‚ùå **No workload integration** - mkdir/rmdir operations aren't driven by tree structure

### Honest Assessment

We have the **design and config**, but we're missing the **execution layer**. It's like having a detailed blueprint for a house but no construction crew.

---

## Question 2: Should we create a shared logical map of directory/file structure?

### Recommendation: YES - STRONGLY RECOMMENDED ‚úÖ

### Current Design Problem

- Each agent generates tree independently via `DirectoryTree::new(config)`
- Deterministic algorithm means they *should* agree, but:
  - No verification they actually do agree
  - No shared knowledge of which paths exist
  - Path selection has no ground truth to work from

### Proposed: Shared Tree Manifest

Create a serializable tree manifest that all agents can use:

```rust
pub struct TreeManifest {
    /// All directory paths in the tree
    pub all_directories: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Directories grouped by depth level
    pub by_level: HashMap<usize, Vec<String>>,
    
    /// For partitioned/exclusive modes: which agent owns which paths
    pub agent_assignments: HashMap<usize, Vec<String>>,
    
    /// Metadata for validation
    pub config_hash: String,  // Verify all agents used same config
    pub total_dirs: usize,
    pub total_files: usize,
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Deterministic coordination** - All agents agree on exact structure
2. **Efficient path selection** - Pre-computed assignments for exclusive/partitioned modes
3. **Validation** - Controller can verify agents created correct structure
4. **Debugging** - Save manifest to file for post-mortem analysis
5. **Resume capability** - Can restart workload without recreating tree

### Implementation Options

**Option A: Controller generates and distributes** (RECOMMENDED)
- Controller runs `DirectoryTree::new()` once
- Serializes manifest to JSON/YAML
- Sends to all agents via gRPC
- Agents use manifest instead of generating tree locally

**Pros:**
- Fits existing sai3-bench architecture (controller coordinates everything)
- No extra files for users to manage
- Works with isolated filesystems (no shared storage needed)
- Easy to version and validate

**Option B: Embedded in config file**
- User (or tool) pre-generates manifest
- Include in YAML as `directory_manifest: !include tree.json`
- All agents read same manifest

**Pros:**
- Explicit and transparent
- Can be version controlled
- Easy to inspect/modify

**Cons:**
- Extra file management for users
- Manual generation step

**Option C: First agent generates and shares**
- First agent generates tree, saves manifest
- Subsequent agents download manifest
- Requires shared filesystem or coordination service

**Cons:**
- Requires shared filesystem or coordination service
- Race conditions possible
- More complex coordination

### Decision: Implement Option A first, with Option B as future enhancement

### Summary Scorecard

- **Strong parity (‚úÖ):** 15 features
- **Partial parity (‚ö†Ô∏è):** 3 features  
- **Missing (‚ùå):** 3 features
- **Better than rdf-bench:** 4 features

**Current Parity: ~65%** (accounting for missing implementation)

**After Implementing Tree Creation:**
- Fix: PrepareConfig ‚Üí DirectoryTree integration
- Fix: Workload path selection  
- Fix: Agent coordination
- **Projected Parity: 85%**

### To Reach 90% Parity

1. ‚úÖ Implement tree creation (gets us to 85%)
2. Add I/O rate limiting (iorate parameter) - significant work (~2-3 weeks)
3. Add journaling/data validation recovery - significant work (~2-3 weeks)
4. Add HTML report generation - cosmetic but useful (~1 week)

## Strategic Assessment

### Where sai3-bench is BETTER ‚ú®

1. **Modern architecture** - gRPC, YAML, HDR histograms (state-of-the-art 2025)
2. **Cloud storage support** - S3/Azure/GCS native support (rdf-bench has NONE)
3. **Multi-backend abstraction** - ObjectStore trait provides backend-agnostic code
4. **Explicit contention control** - 4 path selection strategies vs. rdf-bench's implicit behavior
5. **Better distributed config** - SSH automation, container deployment, per-agent customization

### Where rdf-bench is BETTER üèÜ

1. **I/O rate control** - Critical for real-world simulation (iorate=max vs. fixed rates)
2. **Journaling** - Cross-run validation and crash recovery testing
3. **Mature ecosystem** - 20+ years of production use at Oracle, HP, IBM
4. **Raw device support** - Fine-grained O_DIRECT, O_SYNC control
5. **Platform breadth** - Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Windows (7 platforms vs. 3)

### Positioning

sai3-bench is **NOT a drop-in replacement** for rdf-bench, but a **complementary modern tool** that:
- Excels at cloud storage testing (S3/GCS/Azure) where rdf-bench cannot operate
- Provides modern distributed architecture (gRPC, containers, SSH automation)
- Offers explicit control over multi-client contention
- Uses industry-standard formats (YAML, HDR histograms, TSV)

For pure local filesystem testing against traditional storage arrays, rdf-bench remains superior due to I/O rate control and journaling. For cloud-native workloads and modern storage systems, sai3-bench is the better choice.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Tree Creation Logic (Current Priority)

**Goal:** Activate the directory tree infrastructure we've built

**Tasks:**
1. Integrate `PrepareConfig.directory_structure` with prepare phase
2. Implement `TreeManifest` struct (Option A: controller-generated)
3. Add tree creation logic in `src/workload.rs::prepare_phase()`
4. Handle all 3 tree creation modes:
   - `isolated`: Each agent creates under agent-{id}/ prefix
   - `coordinator`: Controller creates once, agents skip
   - `concurrent`: All agents create (idempotent mkdir)
5. Add 15+ integration tests for tree creation
6. Update example configs with working directory_structure

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Success Criteria:**
- `cargo test --lib` passes with tree creation tests
- Example config creates actual directory structure
- All 3 tree creation modes work correctly
- Distributed test creates same structure across agents

### Phase 2: Path Selection in Workload (Next)

**Goal:** Use tree structure to drive workload operations

**Tasks:**
1. Implement path selection strategies in workload executor:
   - `random`: Pick any directory randomly
   - `partitioned`: Hash-based assignment (prefer own partition)
   - `exclusive`: Only use assigned directories
   - `weighted`: Probabilistic mix via partition_overlap
2. Integrate with existing GET/PUT/DELETE/Mkdir/Rmdir operations
3. Add path selection to file creation (files_per_dir)
4. Add 10+ tests for path selection logic

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Success Criteria:**
- Workload operations target directories from tree
- Contention levels match path_selection strategy
- Exclusive mode has zero path collisions
- Partitioned mode shows expected overlap

### Phase 3: Agent Coordination (Final)

**Goal:** Multi-agent tree creation works correctly

**Tasks:**
1. Implement coordinator mode (controller creates, agents wait)
2. Implement concurrent mode (race-safe idempotent mkdir)
3. Add TreeManifest serialization/deserialization
4. gRPC methods for manifest distribution
5. Add 10+ tests for multi-agent scenarios

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

**Success Criteria:**
- 3+ agents can create same tree structure
- Coordinator mode avoids duplicate work
- Concurrent mode handles mkdir races gracefully
- TreeManifest validates structure across agents

### Total Phase 1-3: ~7-10 days ‚Üí 85% parity achieved

---

## Future Enhancements (Beyond 85%)

### I/O Rate Control (‚Üí90% parity)
- Add `iorate` parameter to workload config
- Token bucket or leaky bucket rate limiter
- Per-operation rate limits
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks (complex scheduler changes)

### Journaling (‚Üí92% parity)
- Write operation log for validation
- Cross-run data validation
- Crash recovery testing
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks (new subsystem)

### HTML Reports (‚Üí93% parity)
- Replace TSV with HTML output
- Response time histograms (graphical)
- Executive summary dashboard
- **Effort:** 1 week (mostly formatting)

### Sequential Access Patterns (‚Üí95% parity)
- Explicit sequential read/write
- Stride patterns
- Hot-banding support
- **Effort:** 1 week (workload patterns)

---

## Conclusion

We have built a **solid foundation** (65% parity) with a **clear path forward** (85% achievable in ~10 days). The remaining gap to match rdf-bench's full capabilities would require **months of engineering** for diminishing returns.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Focus on our **unique strengths** (cloud storage, modern architecture) rather than pure rdf-bench parity. We offer complementary capabilities for the 2025+ storage landscape.

**Next Action:** Implement Phase 1 (Tree Creation Logic) to activate all the infrastructure we've built and reach operational 85% parity.
